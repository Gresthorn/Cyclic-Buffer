# Cyclic-Buffer
The cyclic buffer is a basic component of data reciever which tries to minimize number of functions called by program for memory and buffer management. Availible classes, however must be prepared for different situations (fast data arrival, small amount of memory availible etc.) and provide methods for quick and efficient solutions. They need to be flexible and allow program to access the buffer even in the lowest level if it request for it. Project also contains another structures useful especially for USB sensor network buffers since this project is a component of UWB sensor network system.
